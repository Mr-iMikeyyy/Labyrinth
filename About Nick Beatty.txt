I am Nick, a 24 year old software development student. I grew up as a musician, writing and performing songs since I was in 4th grade where I formed my first band. In my free time outside of music and programming, I enjoy skateboarding and playing video games.
I look forward to learning more as a developer, expanding my knowlege of object oriented programming as well as web and mobile development.
