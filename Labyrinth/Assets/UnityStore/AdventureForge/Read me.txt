PBR Mushroom Pack Lite

PBR Mushroom Pack Lite contains 4 different mushrooms as a sample of our full version PBR Mushrom Pack. 
The textures are PBR and ready for use with Unity’s standard shader. In the full version you also get prefabs
with ready LOD system setup.

All textures are placed in an atlas and includes Albedo, Specular/Smoothness and Normal with texture atlas in 1k.


Average triangles: 400.
Average verts: 340.
Texture atlas size: 1024 px.

Nice to know:
Every FBX got one single Smoothing Group for optimization. “Generate Lightmap” is enabled in every FBX, 
and “Import Materials” is disabled. Enabling “Import Materials” will give you an extra material folder 
below each mushroom type folder and might cause disorder in your project folder. No FBX has 
“Generate Colliders” enabled. Every prefab is set to Static.
