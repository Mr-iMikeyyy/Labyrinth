Hey all! A lil about me:

Started my coding journey in 2020 messing around with javascript. Learned I could flex my 3d skills in game design
and threejs shortly after. Started going to school for computer science in 2021. 

I play hockey, soccer, and rock climb in my free time. My dog is my best friend. Also a pretty heavy
gamer.

 I'm a 3D Artist and Visual Jockey. Gallery: instagram.com/mad_mikes_visuals

Thanks for checking me out!
