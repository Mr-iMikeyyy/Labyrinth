Hello! My name is Mitchell Furman. I'm currently a CIS major who is attending classes here at WCC to transfer to EMU after I finish the classes here. I am 22 years old and have been interested in coding and computers to years. I love playing games online with friends. Right now a couple favorites of mine are Destiny 2 and Elden Ring. I currently have experience in C++ and Linux Coding and am currently working on Php and C# activities!
