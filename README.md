I am Ivan Huang, I like all sorts of games. DnD, Runescape, Mario Party, Etc. Programming is has always been interesting to me.
If you think about it, it's kinda like an puzzle game and creating a program is just finding a solution to the puzzle.
This is way more interesting then what I was going to do originally. Originally I was going to be an accountant, but
this just suits me better.

## Lore
In the heart of the ancient island of Crete, an enigmatic labyrinth conceals a dark secret. This impenetrable maze was designed by the ingenious Daedalus to contain the fearsome Minotaur, a half-man, half-bull creature that terrorizes all who dare to enter.

Rumors speak of a locked inner sanctum deep within the winding passages, where the Eternal Flame burns, offering freedom and salvation to those who find it. Yet, the Flame's guardians have hidden a mystical key in the farthest reaches of the labyrinth, ensuring that only the most worthy can unlock the sanctum's doors.

As a daring adventurer, you venture into the labyrinth in search of the elusive key, determined to outwit the cunning Minotaur and claim your place among legends. The echoing growls of the beast fill the air as you navigate the ever-shifting passages, your bravery and wits pitted against the formidable creature's instincts and ferocity.

Each step brings new challenges, as the labyrinth's walls shift and change with every turn. Time is of the essence, as the Minotaur draws closer, driven by an insatiable hunger for the hunt.

With the mystical key finally in hand, you race to the inner sanctum, the Minotaur's breath hot on your heels. As you unlock the door, the Eternal Flame casts its warm glow upon your face, promising freedom and safety from the monstrous beast.

The door closes behind you, and the Minotaur's roars fade into the distance. You have escaped the treacherous labyrinth, forever etching your name in the annals of history as the one who defied the Minotaur and triumphed over the darkness.
