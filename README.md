I'm a full time student and a part time software engineer for a company based out of Arizona. I've been developing in C# for about 8 years now. I have various skills ranging from basic hardware engineering to cyber security, in addition to full stack engineering. My Favorite stack at the moment is asp.net, MSSQL, Redis(if needed), angular or svelte and k8s.
